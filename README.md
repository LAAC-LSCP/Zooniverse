# Zooniverse Pipeline for Long Format Recordings

A pipeline to create, upload and analyse long format recordings using the Zooniverse citizen science platform.

## Description

The pipeline comprises three folders:
* /create_subjects contains scripts to segment daylong recordings into small chunks (400ms) and write a metadata file.
* /upload_subjects contains a script to upload data on the zooniverse platform, using the [Panoptes API](https://panoptes.docs.apiary.io/#).
* /zoon_analysis contains scripts to convert Zooniverse data to json format and perform analysis in R.
